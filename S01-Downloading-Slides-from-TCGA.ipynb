    "- `TCGA-KIRC`\n",
    "- `TCGA-KIPP`\n",
    "- `TCGA-KICH`\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "You could use `./gdc-client download --help` for usage or visit https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/Data_Download_and_Upload/ for an official reference.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE:\n",
    "- `DIR_TO_DOWNLOAD` should be the directory to download files to. Defaults to current directory.\n",
    "- `PATH_TO_MANIFEST_FILE` should be GDC download manifest file (e.g., `gdc_manifest_XXXXXXXX.txt`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To show you the complete procedure, I simply use the following path configurations for reading or saving files:\n",
