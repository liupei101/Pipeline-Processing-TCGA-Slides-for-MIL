üìö Recent updates:
- 24/12/18: add a new feature extractor `CONCH_v1.5` from [`TITAN`](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN)
- 24/12/06: add a new feature extractor `UNI`
- 24/06/01: add new features: allowing users to specify **a unified magnification** for patching and feature extraction
- 24/05/08: update codes & readme

## Overview

This repo provides **a complete and detailed tutorial** for users who intend to **process TCGA Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) for downstream computational tasks**, such as WSI classification and survival analysis (basically with multiple-instance learning (MIL) as the learning paradigm). 

üî• Moreover, this repo also provides [an improved version](./tools/CLAM) of original [CLAM](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM). This improvoed version has more practical features: 
- allowing users to **specify a unified magnification** for patching and feature extractiong,
- **patch-level image transformations** for model rubostness test, e.g. Gaussian bluring and stain variation.
- **diverse architectures / networks** for patch feature extracting

üí° A quick overview of what convenience this repo could provide for you:
- **Step-by-step instructions to download complete TCGA data**, including WSIs and corresponding label of interest. This is not presented in CLAM.
- **Detailed steps to process WSIs**, including WSI segmentation & patching and patch feature extraction. Two notebooks are given to show the details that need to be noticed when using CLAM for WSI preprocessing.
- **More alternative pretrained models for patch feature extraction**, currently with support of [truncated ResNet50 (CLAM)](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM), [ResNet18 w/ SimCL (DSMIL)](https://github.com/binli123/dsmil-wsi), [CTransPath](https://github.com/Xiyue-Wang/TransPath), [CLIP](https://github.com/openai/CLIP), [PLIP](https://github.com/PathologyFoundation/plip), [UNI](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/UNI), [CONCH](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CONCH), and [CONCH_v1.5](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/TITAN).

üìù This repo is developed from [***PseMix***](https://github.com/liupei101/PseMix), previously. Now it has been moved out as an individual project for maintaining convenience. 

*On updating*. Stay tuned!

Feel free to post your issue in this repo if you encounter any problems.

## Walkthrough

üë©‚Äçüíª Here show you how to use this repo:
- S01: [Downloading slides from TCGA websites](./S01-Downloading-Slides-from-TCGA.ipynb). It shows you, step by step, how to obtain the data you want from TCGA. 
- S02: [Reorganizing slides at patient-level](./S02-Reorganizing-Slides-at-Patient-Level.ipynb). It provides the code for organizing slides at patient-level and shows you how to get the useful label data (slide-level) that you would possibly utilize in downstream computational tasks. 
- S03: [Segmenting and patching slides](./S03-Segmenting-and-Patching-Slides.ipynb). It shows you the complete procedures and results of tissue segmentation and patching. Also, the basic knowledge of WSI structure is given.
- S04: [Extracting patch features](./S04-Extracting-Patch-Features.ipynb). It shows you the complete procedures and results of patch feature extraction. 6+ pertained models are supported and can be easily used with this step. 

üìù Some notes:
- It is strongly recommended to use `CONCH`/`UNI`/`CONCH_v1.5` in patch feature extraction (S04)
- If you cannot use `CONCH`/`UNI`/`CONCH_v1.5` due to limited access rights, `CTransPath` and `PLIP` are good alternatives (both are free for use). Their usage is provided in [tools/scripts](https://github.com/liupei101/Pipeline-Processing-TCGA-Slides-for-MIL/tree/main/tools/scripts).
- The `truncated ResNet50` and `ResNet18 w/ SimCL` are **NOT** recommended in patch feature extraction. 

## Acknowledgement
We thank [CLAM team](https://github.com/mahmoodlab/CLAM) for contributing such an efficient and easy-to-use tool for WSI preprocessing, and [TCGA team](https://www.cancer.gov/ccg/research/genome-sequencing/tcga) for making WSI data publicly-available to facilitate research.
